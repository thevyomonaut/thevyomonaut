<h2 align="center">I'm Sanghamitra De, welcome to my GitHub! :vulcan_salute:</h2>

<p> :books: I am currently pursuing a Bachelors course in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur (Batch of 2025). </p>

<p> :pen: Here you will find all the files I used to create my projects, and some writeups to my solutions of some programming problems. You'll also find the data files that I have used in some of my projects. </p>

<p> :computer: As of now I am interested in Data Science and Computer Security. I _love love looooove_ coding in Python, which is great because Python might be the most powerful language out there. You'll see that most of my projects are also written in Python. On the other hand, I love the feeling when you have to tear apart the system to find the flag in a CTF contest!  <!--- edit must --->
